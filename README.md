# Slide 1: Introduction
  Title: Polymorphism in Java - Example Implementation
Brief explanation of polymorphism and its importance in object-oriented programming.

# Slide 2: Animais Interface
  Code of the Animais interface with the makeSound() method.
Explanation that an interface defines a contract for classes that implement it.
Highlight that the Animais interface is the generic type that allows polymorphism.

# Slide 3: Dog Class
  Code of the Dog class that implements the Animais interface and provides the makeSound() method.
Show how the Dog class represents a specific type of animal.

# Slide 4: Cat Class
  Code of the Cat class that implements the Animais interface and provides the makeSound() method.
Show how the Cat class represents another specific type of animal.

# Slide 5: main() Method
  Code of the main() method where objects of the Dog and Cat classes are created.
Explanation that the objects are referenced as type Animais, allowing polymorphism.
Highlight the method calls to makeSound() on each object.

# Slide 6: Output
  Presentation of the output in the console: "The dog makes: Woof!" and "The cat makes: Meow!".
Explanation that, even though they are referenced as type Animais, the objects execute the appropriate method based on the specific class's implementation.

# Slide 7: Conclusion
  Reiteration of the importance of polymorphism in code flexibility and extensibility.
Emphasize that polymorphism allows treating objects from different classes as if they were of the same generic type.
Thank you and open the floor for questions.
